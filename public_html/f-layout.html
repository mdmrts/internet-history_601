        Microsoft is a multinational computer technology corporation. Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.
        In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released the Mosaic browser, which was amongst the first graphical web browsers, and it quickly rose to dominance.
        Marc Andreessen and James H. Clark started the Mosaic Communications Corporation in April 1994. Andreessen and his team create a new browser called Netscape Navigator. Netscape Navigator improved on Mosaic’s feature and helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, by 1995 it dominated the browser market share. While in development, the Netscape Navigator browser’s codename was Mozilla, a portmanteau of Mosaic and Godzilla.

        In 1995 Microsoft decided to develop/buy its own browser, and this leads to a nearly six year long war with Netscape. The first version of Internet Explorer was released in August 1995. A few months later, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 2.0 free to all users, even commercial ones. One of the longest lasting features to come out of this first browser war was the development of the Javascript programming language by Brenden Eich in 10 days in May 1995 for Netscape. Other “features” that have been lost to the sands of time include JScript ,and JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS), which attempted to compete with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for a few months in 1996.
