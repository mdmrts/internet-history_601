        <b>Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)</b>, later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) the agency was created on February 7, 1958 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957.
        In 1962, a scientist from M.I.T. and ARPA named <b>J.C.R. Licklider </b>proposed a solution to what might happen in the event of a Soviet attack on the nation’s telephone system.:<b> a “galactic network” </b>of computers that could talk to one another. Such a network would enable government leaders to communicate even if the Soviets destroyed the telephone system.

        In 1965, another M.I.T. scientist <b>Paul Baran </b>developed a way of sending information from one computer to another that he called <b>“packet switching.” </b>Packet switching breaks data down into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. That way, each packet can take its own route from place to place.
        On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: <b>a “node-to-node”</b> communication from one computer to another.
        As packet-switched computer networks multiplied, however, it became more difficult for them to integrate into a single worldwide “internet.”

    By the end of the 1970s, <b>Vinton Cerf </b>had begun to solve this problem by developing a way for all of the computers on all of the world’s mini-networks to communicate with one another. He called his invention <b>“Transmission Control Protocol,” or TCP.</b> (Later, he added an additional protocol, known as<b> “Internet Protocol.” </b>The acronym we use to refer to these today is TCP/IP.)
    In 1991 <b>Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web</b>: an internet that was not simply a way to send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve.
