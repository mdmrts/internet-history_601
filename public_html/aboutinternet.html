        <b>The Domain Name System (DNS) </b>is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses.

        <b> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.
            <b> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b>is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markuplanguage is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document.

        <b>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)</b> is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.
            <b>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </b>is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential
