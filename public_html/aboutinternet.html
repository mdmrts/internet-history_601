        <b>An IP address </b>is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.
        <b> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b> is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.

        <b> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.
            <b> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b>is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markuplanguage is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document.

        <b>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)</b> is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.
            <b>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </b>is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential
