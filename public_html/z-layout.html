        YAHOO was established by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. In 2000, it was the most popular website worldwide. Usage declined in the late 2000s as it lost market share to Google. •	Sun Microsystems, Inc., founded by Andreas Bechtolsheim, William Joy, Vinod Khosla, and Scott McNealy  in 1982 for the purpose of selling low-cost high-performance desktop computers running the UNIX operating system. •	Bill Gross started Idealab in 1996 to create and operate pioneering technology companies. The structure of Idealab has allowed us to test many ideas at once and turn the best of them into companies, attracting the human and financial capital necessary to bring them to market. GOOGLE was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.
